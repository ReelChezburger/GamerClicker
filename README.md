# GamerClicker
A clicker designed to replicate how a person clicks their mouse.

This project was made to grind mobs inside of a Pay-to-win server in Minecraft while not being detected by anti-cheat. It randomly picks a CPS within a range, and fluidly mooves between CPS valus. More features are planned as well.
